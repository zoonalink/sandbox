    "A CNN typically works by extracting features from images, and then feeding those features into a fully connected neural network to generate a prediction. The feature extraction layers in the network have the effect of reducing the number of features from the potentially huge array of individual pixel values to a smaller feature set that supports label prediction."

    "1. An image is passed to the convolutional layer. In this case, the image is a simple geometric shape.\n",
    "2. The image is composed of an array of pixels with values between 0 and 255 (for color images, this is usually a 3-dimensional array with values for red, green, and blue channels).\n",
    "3. A filter kernel is generally initialized with random weights (in this example, we've chosen values to highlight the effect that a filter might have on pixel values; but in a real CNN, the initial weights would typically be generated from a random Gaussian distribution). This filter will be used to extract a feature map from the image data.\n",
    "4. The filter is convolved across the image, calculating feature values by applying a sum of the weights multiplied by their corresponding pixel values in each position. A Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is applied to ensure negative values are set to 0.\n",
    "5. After convolution, the feature map contains the extracted feature values, which often emphasize key visual attributes of the image. In this case, the feature map highlights the edges and corners of the triangle in the image."

    "Dropping layers\n",
    "One of the most difficult challenges in a CNN is the avoidance of overfitting, where the resulting model performs well with the training data but doesn't generalize well to new data on which it wasn't trained. One technique you can use to mitigate overfitting is to include layers in which the training process randomly eliminates (or \"drops\") feature maps. This may seem counterintuitive, but it's an effective way to ensure that the model doesn't learn to be over-dependent on the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other techniques you can use to mitigate overfitting include randomly flipping, mirroring, or skewing the training images to generate data that varies between training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening layers\n",
    "After using convolutional and pooling layers to extract the salient features in the images, the resulting feature maps are multidimensional arrays of pixel values. A flattening layer is used to flatten the feature maps into a vector of values that can be used as input to a fully connected layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers\n",
    "Usually, a CNN ends with a fully connected network in which the feature values are passed into an input layer, through one or more hidden layers, and generate predicted values in an output layer.\n",

    "3. A dropping layer randomly drops some of the feature maps to help prevent overfitting.\n",
