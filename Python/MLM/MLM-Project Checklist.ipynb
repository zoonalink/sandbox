    "  * To clean and prepare the test set\n",
    "  * To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live\n",
    "  * To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Fix or remove outliers (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…​) or drop their rows (or columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform feature selection (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform feature engineering, where appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Discretize continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x2, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Aggregate features into promising new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform feature scaling:\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the data is huge, you may want to sample smaller training sets so you can train many different models in a reasonable time (be aware that this penalizes complex models such as large neural nets or random forests).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once again, try to automate these steps as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train many quick-and-dirty models from different categories (e.g., linear, naive Bayes, SVM, random forest, neural net, etc.) using standard parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measure and compare their performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.\n",

    "4. Analyze the types of errors the models make:\n",

    "* What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will want to use as much data as possible for this step, especially as you move toward the end of fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As always, automate what you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when you are not sure about them (e.g., if you’re not sure whether to replace missing values with zeros or with the median value, or to just drop the rows).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek et al.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often produce better performance than running them individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on the test set to estimate the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "`WARNING`\n",
    "Don’t tweak your model after measuring the generalization error: you would just start overfitting the test set.\n"

    "1. Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.).\n",

    "2. Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Beware of slow degradation: models tend to “rot” as data evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a crowdsourcing service).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Also monitor your inputs’ quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, or another team’s output becoming stale). This is particularly important for online learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible).\n",
