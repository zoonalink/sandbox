Much of the work in this class will be done via R Markdown documents. R Markdown documents are documents that combine text, R code, and R output, including figures. They are a great way to produce self-contained and documented statistical analyses.

In this first worksheet, you will learn how to do some basic markdown editing. After you have made a change to the document, press "Knit HTML" in R Studio and see what kind of a result you get.

Edit only below this line.

---------------------------------------------

## 1. Basic Markdown editing

Try out basic R Markdown features, as described here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html. Write some text that is bold, and some that is in italics. Make a numbered list and a bulleted list. Make a nested list. Try the block-quote feature.

## 2. Embedding R code

R code embedded in R chunks will be executed and the output will be shown.
```{r}
# R code goes here
x <- rnorm(100)  # random sample from normal distribution
dens <- density(x)    # calculate density
dens

plot(dens)            # plot density
```

Now you try it. For example, take the built-in data set `cars`, which lists speed and stopping distance for cars from the 1920. Plot speed vs. distance, and/or perform a correlation analysis. Then write a few sentences describing what you see.

```{r}
#str(cars)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
cor.test(cars$speed, cars$dist)
cor(cars$speed, cars$dist)

```
